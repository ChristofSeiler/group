We are passionate about teaching, both in the classroom at online e.g. in our highly-rated [Algorithms for DNA Sequencing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing) course on Coursera. We freely distribute teaching materials, including lecture videos, screencasts, lecture notes, and programming notebooks. These span subjects from programming in C/C++ to applied algorithms and data structures in computational biology. See the Teaching Materials page for links and details.

The lab is located at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/).
