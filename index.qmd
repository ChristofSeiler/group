We develop new statistical methods to analyze multi-omics data. We leverage prediction models from machine learning and make them fit for scientific purpose by quantifying their uncertainty. We build models that can learn biological causal mechanisms from experimental data. We are also active contributors of bioinformatics software packages and maintain several R packages on Bioconductor.
