Stefan is a postdoctoral fellow, working as computational scientist in the SYMPHONY project--a collaboration with the Wellcome Sanger Institute and industry partners. Currently, he works on refining best-practices and developing innovative methods for analyzing and harnessing large-scale single-cell perturbation screens, with the ultimate goal to nominate novel treatment targets or combinations.

During his Math studies in Munich he worked on scvelo, a scanpy-based tool for RNA velocity inference. Afterwards, during his PhD in Bioinformatics at the Charit√© and Humboldt University of Berlin, his research focused on analysis and methods for single-cell data, applied to targeted pathway inhibition in colorectal cancer organoids, COVID-19 animal models, and large-scale single-cell perturbation datasets.
