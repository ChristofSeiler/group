Miriam is a bioinformatician and works as a data manager and research software engineer for the INTeRCePT consortium in collaboration with The LOOP Z端rich. She holds a M.Sc. in Medical Biology from Radboud University (Netherlands) and two bachelors in Bioinformatics (B.Sc. B.S.) from the Johannes Kepler University in Linz (Austria) and the University of South Bohemia (Czech Republic).

Previously, Miriam worked at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego (USA) on the development of a data analysis pipeline for the prediction of immune cell recognition using protein features. She also spent some time at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, where she created a CRISPR screen analysis pipeline that processes raw sequencing data to identify significant gene hits that contribute to resistance or sensitivity to HER2-positive gastric cancer.
