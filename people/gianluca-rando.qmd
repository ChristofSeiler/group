I am Gianluca Randò, I'm from Italy and have a background in physics. I'm currently enrolled in a Data Science course at Maastricht University. I'm part of this project as an intern, and I'm very excited about it because I like the idea of applying my knowledge to solve real problems of interest for the community. That’s why I'm also interested in social science and economics, as well as biomedicine.

During my time here, I will help evaluate how good [conformeR] is compared to differential analysis methods. Then, I will collaborate in searching for a way to speed up [conformeR]'s implementation to enable real-time analysis. Finally, I will contribute to developing a new approach that uses conformal p-values directly, instead of using the current indirect method.
