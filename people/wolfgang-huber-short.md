Wolfgang enjoys working at the interface of exploring new datasets using R and latest packages and methods from all around the community, statistical method development, and deriving new insights on basic biology or translational applications.

Trained as a theoretical physicist, he now considers himself a statistician. He enjoys working with a brilliant team of master students, PhD candidates, postdocs and staff scientist, with outstanding colleagues at EMBL and with an international network of collaborators.

When he is not working on science, he enjoys spending time with his two sons, or biking up the hills around Heidelberg and elsewhere.
