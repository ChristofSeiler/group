Matthias is a bioinformatician who is interested in applying machine learning methods to questions of biomedical relevance. He currently specializes in analyzing highly multiplexed fluorescence microscopy images of Non-Hodgkin B cell lymphoma. He holds BSc and MSc degrees in bioinformatics from the Technical University of Munich and Ludwig-Maxmilians-Universit√§t Munich.

Previously, Matthias conducted research on mitochondrial fidelity by analysis high-throughput loss-of-function-screens at the Gene Center Munich. He also spent some time at Helmholtz Munich, where he explored drug repositioning approaches against tuberculosis and employed statistical and machine learning methods to investigate molecular mechanisms behind acute-on-chronic liver failure.
