Wolfgang enjoys exploring new datasets, developing statisticals method, and discovering new biologcal insights.
Trained in theoretical physics, he now considers himself a statistician. He is happy to work with a brilliant team of master students, PhD candidates, postdocs and staff scientists, with outstanding colleagues at EMBL and with an international network of collaborators. When he is not working on science, he likes to spend time with his two sons, or biking up the hills around Heidelberg and elsewhere.

Wolfgang works as a research group leader in computational biology and statistical/computational method development for novel biotechnologies, new data types and large systematic datasets.

He is an EMBL Senior Scientist, a co-director of the [Molecular Medicine Partnership Unit](https://www.embl.org/about/info/mmpu), a joint venture between the Medical Faculty of the University of Heidelberg and EMBL, a co-head of the [Theory Transversal Theme](https://www.embl.org/about/programme/research-plans/theory-at-embl) at EMBL, and a co-head of EMBL's Open Science working group.

He is a founding member of [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org), a large, collaborative, international open-source software project for the analysis and comprehension of biological data. He is also a fellow of the International Society for Computational Biology, and an elected Member of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO). 

He received a PhD in Theoretical Physics from the University of Freiburg, Germany, in 1998 for work on master equation models and their numerical simulation, with applications in biology and in quantum optics.

He conducted postdoctoral research in cheminformatics at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California in 1998-99. He switched to bioinformatics and cancer transcriptomics for a second postdoc at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Germany, in 2000-04. 

He started a research group at EMBL-EBI (European Bioinformatics Institute) in beautiful Cambridge, UK, in 2004.

In 2009, he joined the new Genome Biology unit at EMBL Heidelberg.

With Susan Holmes, he co-wrote the textbook [Modern Statistics for Modern Biology](https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb).

Wolfgang is interested in open source software community building, and engages in courses, workshops and consortia that help drive these. He is also deeply committed to cross-disciplinary scientific training: teaching biologists and medical researchers in statistics, computation and AI, and teaching computational scientists in biological applications and data generating technologies.
