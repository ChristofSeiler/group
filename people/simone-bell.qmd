Simone is responsible for strategic and day-to-day project management for a portfolio of collaborative multi-site projects. She takes responsibilities in project proposal conception and writing (in particular resourcing and budgeting), and in operational set-up, staffing, operations, reporting, and finalization.

Simone has more than 15 years experience in research projects in the life sciences. She has authored several project proposals together with the Huber Group and external collaborators, of which 75% were funded. She takes up community support and management roles in international projects and frequently interacts with collaborators across Europe and beyond. Her portfolio includes long lasting experience in the organisation of off-site events, scientific retreats, courses and conferences in Europe and abroad.
