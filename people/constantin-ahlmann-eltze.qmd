Constantin develops statistical methods for the analysis of high-throughput biological data. He studied molecular biotechnology and is currently finishing his PhD, where he compared preprocessing tools for single-cell data and has developed a new tool to predict the differential expression patterns of multi-condition single-cell data. He maintains ten R packages for scientific applications, for which he was recently awarded the Bioconductor Award. In his free time, he enjoys cycling, bouldering, and traveling.
