Wolfgang enjoys exploring new datasets using R and latest packages and methods from all around the community, developing statistical method for new biological data types, and deriving new insights on basic biology or translational applications.

Trained as a theoretical physicist, he now considers himself a statistician. He is happy to work with a brilliant team of master students, PhD candidates, postdocs and staff scientist, with outstanding colleagues at EMBL and with an international network of collaborators.

When he is not working on science, he likes to spend time with his two sons, or biking up the hills around Heidelberg and elsewhere.
