Erin's research focuses on identifying how genomic changes alter cellular interactions and tissue architecture in B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and method development for single-cell spatial analysis of multiplexed immunofluorescence images.

Before joining EMBL, Erin studied molecular biology and computer science at Boston University. During her degree she completed research internships in sequence analysis at the A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute, and a final year project in the BUMC Hematology and Oncology Department researching triple-negative breast cancer.
