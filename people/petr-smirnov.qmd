Petr is a postdoctoral fellow, working together with the Genome Instability in Tumours group of Aur√©lie Ernst at DKFZ. His current research involves deciphering subclonal genomic instability using single cell technologies, as well as investigating how modern AI image models can be used to decipher the impact of genomics on tumour and stromal spatial organization and morphology. 

Petr holds a Doctorate in Medical Biophysics from the University of Toronto, where his research focused on statistical approaches to discover robust biomarkers predictive of drug response.
