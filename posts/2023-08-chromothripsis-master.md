## About the project 


Chromothripsis is a catastrophic rearrangement of the genome that leads to simultaneous acquisition of numerous genomic aberrations. Discovered in 2010, it occurs in 30-50% of all tumors, but the biological processes that facilitate or are induced by chromothripsis remain unclear. Furthermore, while chromothripsis is associated with poor prognosis across tumor types, the mechanisms by which this occurs and how chromothripsis interacts with treatment responses are poorly understood. We investigate these questions using large cohorts of tumors characterized by genome sequencing, and by clinical variables including treatment outcomes and survival of the corresponding patients. We consider specific tumor types as well as the pan-cancer context.

We are looking for a Master student with good skills in computational biology (R, Python, basic statistics) to characterize the disease-related consequences of chromothripsis. She/he will work together with a postdoc to computationally identify cases of chromothripsis across thousands of tumors, and to discover statistical relationships between chromothripsis and clinical outcomes, as well as with other genomic and transcriptomic features of these tumors. This project is embedded within a larger collaboration between the Ernst and Huber labs to understand spatial and intratumoral heterogeneity in chromothriptic tumors based on imaging and single cell omics modalities, to which the student may also contribute. 

Applications should be sent to Wolfgang Huber (wolfgang.huber@embl.org) and Aurélie Ernst (a.ernst@dkfz.de). Please include your CV, university transcripts, and samples of your work (research reports, computer code, data analysis notebooks).


## About the team 

The research group of Wolfgang Huber at EMBL develops statistical data analysis and machine learning methods for modern biotechnologies, applies them to biological and biomedical discovery, and translates them into reusable tools by engaging in open source software communities. The interdisciplinary and international team has strong collaborations with researchers in cancer and developmental biology. They use cutting edge experimental data to discover and understand biological processes and to develop new biomedical applications. 

The research group of Aurélie Ernst aims at achieving a better understanding of how chromothripsis arises and at assessing potential implications for cancer patients. More specifically, its goals are 1) to characterize in which context chromothripsis occurs and which evolutionary dynamics chromothriptic tumors may have 2) to decipher the mechanistic basis of chromothripsis 3) to target vulnerabilities of tumor cells with chromothripsis. For this, the Ernst group uses approaches encompassing single-cell genomics, functional testing in model systems and pre-clinical studies in mice.
