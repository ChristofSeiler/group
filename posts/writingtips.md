# Wolfgang's scientific writing tips

- Present experimental observations and measurements in past tense, and interpretations and conclusions in present tense. The statements in past tense are the real, hard substance of the paper that make it worthwhile. Anyone can speculate and toss around generalities.
- Use one term per concept, and one concept per term. I.e., avoid lexical variation, as it just adds unnecessary mental load on the reader (“Do they really mean the same? Or do they mean to leave room for some subtle distinction?”). Similarly do not overload the same word with multiple meanings. A frequent example of that is using the same word for data that were actually measured, versus what the authors want them to mean. It is a mark of a good scientist to care about the difference.
- In the Results section, focus on what you did. Musings about what you or someone could have done or do instead are (if at all) for the Discussion.
- Beware of dangling participles. Even if the intended meaning is clear. You may think you sound sophisticated, but it actually undermines you. Similarly for dangling pronouns.
- If you want to use fancy sounding words, make sure you really understand them, and that they fit.
- Spell out abbreviations. You may think that you make the text more readable by saving a few characters, but the opposite is the case. Many readers do not read the paper linearly from beginning to end, and instead jump around or start in the middle. Even if you think a certain abbreviation is obvious, you will be surprised by how many readers you lose this way. 
- It's great to recall definitions of a scientific term, as a courtesy to the reader. Consult standard textbooks or at least Wikipedia before making up your own.
- Make each point once, and properly, and then move on. Avoid being repetitive. For instance, state the objective of the work, or of a particular portion of it, clearly and explicitly at the outset, and then just get on with describing the steps, and results; do not keep repeating the motives.
- Make sure there is logical progression. Avoid sounding circular. E.g., you can start a paragraph with stating a conclusion, and then provide your logical, fact-based argument for it, based on your premises. Or, start with the premises, and then go through the logical steps to arrive at a conclusion. But do not put the conclusion, or the premises, both at the start and end of a paragraph. The reader will likely end up being puzzled about what was actually achieved.
- Use a spell-checker.
- Putting terms in quotes tends to look “unprofessional” and can in most cases be avoided by being more careful about the choice of words.  
- If multiple spellings are possible for a term (e.g., hyphenation), pick one and stick with it.

### Figures:
- Colors are a great way of encoding a categorical or continuous variable in your data. Choose the color scheme carefully. There is good advice on this on the internet. If your paper has multiple plots using the same variable, make sure the color scheme is the same.
- Font sizes: make sure all text is large enough to be legible. Make choice of font, font style and sizes consistent across figure panels and figures. 
- Aspect ratio: for plots in which x and y show the same physical or conceptual units, make sure the aspect ratio consistent, i.e., usually 1:1.
