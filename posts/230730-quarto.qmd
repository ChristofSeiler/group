This webpage was built with [quarto](https://quarto.org/).
I used the [RStudio IDE](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) as an editor (but that is secondary).
I really enjoyed the experience:

 - everything is based on simple markdown and YAML files, extensible at will through using R/Python snippets.
 - rapid development
 - the resulting website is static HTML that can be deployed anywhere.
