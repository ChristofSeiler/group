During 2020, I got drafted into a new EMBL working group on [DORA](https://sfdora.org/), whose task was institutional change management towards a more explicit and more visible commitment by the institution to DORA. Initially I was not super-excited about yet more committee work. But I got to realize how important and interesting the topic is. I touches all that we do as scientists. And I got to love my institution even more for its progressive and pragmatic approach. \
