## Conference

![Conference venue](../photos/prbb_beach.png)

The [European Bioconductor Conference](https://eurobioc2025.bioconductor.org) will be in Barcelona this year. Our contributions:

* Justine will present our new R package `conformeR` in a short talk. We propose to leverage prediction models in single-cell differential expression analysis. Congrats, Justine!
* Christof will present our new R package `cellpaintr`. We propose to analyze CellProfiler features following a standard single-cell workflow. Here is the [poster](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16992887).

Both [conformeR] and [cellpaintr] are available on GitHub.
