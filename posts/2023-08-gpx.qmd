One of the things to know about EMBL Heidelberg is the commute to it by bike on pleasant routes through the forest, and pretty decent mountain-biking on the hills around it.

## Bike commute from Heidelberg Weststadt to EMBL

The most obvious route is for cyclists to follow the road that the cars and busses take, up Steigerweg. But in the uphill direction, this can be nasty and unsafe, as the road is narrow and steep, and traffic can be intense. There are better alternatives. Here is one.

## Heidelberg Rohrbach to EMBL via Bierhelder Hof
<!--      -->

Here, an obvious choice of route would be to go up Kühler Grund all the way to Forstquelle (the red <font color="red">A</font> on the map) and then continue left on Bierhelderhofweg. But the latter is part is not good: narrow, steep, obstructed view, fast moving cars. Alternatively, one can turn right at Forstquelle and go past the Heating Station (the red <font color="red">B</font> on the map) through the forest; but it's a bit of a detour. 

Instead, we go up slightly left of Kühler Grund and pass Bierhelder Hof on a paved road that crosses a pleasant meadow with cows. The section on Rotstückweg is a bit steep and unpaved. A more relaxed option is to go via the red <font color="red">C</font> on the map.

The highest point of the tour is a vista point with a popular picnic spot, a [restaurant with an outdoors terrace](https://www.gasthof-koenigstuhl.de/en/restaurants/bergstuben) and a [beergarden-kiosk](https://riosk.de/content/riosk-fuchsbau-k%C3%B6nigstuhl) with a terrace.
