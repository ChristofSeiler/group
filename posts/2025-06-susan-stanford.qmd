## Conference

![Conference group picture](../photos/stanford_susan_group.jpg)

I really enjoyed being back at Stanford for a conference on [Bridging Biology and Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/events/bridging-biology-and-statistics-insights-and-innovations-modern-biology) to celebrate Susan's career and her scientific achievements at the interface of statistics and modern biology. It was great to see everyone after such a long time!

I hope to see everyone again soon!
