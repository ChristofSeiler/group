## On 'data analysis plans' in grant proposals and the like

I often get to read project proposals involving production and analysis of (biological) data, with multi-year time horizons, and very specific choices of methods and tools, nowadays usually spiced up with latest instances of deep neural networks. 

Consider Mike Tyson's "Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the mouth"^[ca. 1987] or 
Helmuth von Moltke's "No plan survives the first enemy contact"^["Kein Operationsplan reicht mit einiger Sicherheit über das erste Zusammentreffen mit der feindlichen Hauptmacht hinaus." - von Moltke, Helmuth Karl Bernhard: "Über Strategie" (1871). In: Kriegsgeschichtliche Einzelschriften, H.13 (1890)]. 

A detailed plan is a nice thing to have - it shows that you know the literature and the methods and tools that exist.

But...: IMHO, more important than the detailed plan is to have the right people, skills, and resources in place and to be able to (re)act quickly upon the data that get produced — if, when, and at the quantity and quality they have - and to possibly rapidly changing scientific questions. This is [not cheap, it needs proper resourcing](compbioisnotcheap.html).

In other words: "Plans are nothing; planning is everything." — Dwight D. Eisenhower.
