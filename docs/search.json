I have a systems-level approach to understanding the biological underpinnings of biological problems. Through a combination of coursework and hands-on experience, I’ve already completed over 800 hours of bioinformatics internships and 480 hours in clinical settings, equipping me with a well-rounded perspective on translational healthcare research. During my BSc, I minored in bioinformatics, and my upcoming thesis applies genome-wide association study (GWAS) techniques to investigate the genetic correlates of depression, hippocampal activation, and episodic memory. In my free time, I enjoy swimming, reading, and running!\nDuring my internship, I will be working on the development of the cellpaintr package in R, specifically in translating the already existing software, pycytominer, from Python to R. The existing software is “Designed for biologists!” and used in biological image processing, specifically looking at single cell images, extracting features, and measuring phenotypes of interest. The goal is to enable reproducible, scalable single cell bioimage analysis for CRISPR and drug perturbation studies, leveraging R’s ecosystem while maintaining compatibility with CellProfiler’s outputs. The resulting tools will support automated quantification of cell phenotypes under different treatment conditions (e.g., disease vs. control)."

The program featured two full days of inspiring talks by women in mathematics—ranging from PhD students and postdocs to full professors—who presented their current research. The range of topics covered highlighted the immense diversity of mathematics as a discipline: PDEs, Lie theory, biostatistics, machine learning, econometrics, functional analysis, geometry, polynomial theory, knot theory, and more. Just as impressive as the topics themselves were the backgrounds of the speakers—women from France, Italy, Russia, China, India, and Iran—each with a unique path and set of opportunities that led them to a career in mathematics.\nIn addition to these rigorous scientific contributions, the conference hosted a roundtable featuring four established mathematicians: Francesca Da Lio (ETH Zurich), Susanna Zimmerman (University of Basel), Antonietta Mira (USI, Insubria), and Donna Testermann (EPFL). They shared candid reflections: What advice do they wish they had received as young researchers? Who inspired them? What sacrifices did they make to balance academic careers with their private lives? These are the very questions many young researchers like myself grapple with—and the insights shared during this session were deeply encouraging.\nUltimately, these two days offered a meaningful opportunity to build connections with fellow young women in mathematics—to exchange ideas about our fields of research, but also about our lived experiences as women in academia.\nI sincerely hope the conference will return for another edition next year!"

    "text": "RAI Platform\nAs many molecular biology labs and clinical research groups leverage modern AI systems in their workflows, we need tools that quantify their uncertainty to uphold scientific standards. In the past, we relied on statistical uncertainty quantification in the form of p-values and confidence intervals. Almost every paper reported those quantities and allowed us to judge the credibility of a research discovery. This common statistical language—although not without its critics—allowed us to focus our resources towards the most promising discoveries. How can we quantify our level of surprise of a discovery from prediction models in a similar fashion?\nIn this project, we will build—in collaboration with Oliver Distler, Michael Krauthammer, and Bjoern Menze—the RAI Platform that will help researchers in biomedicine to quantify uncertainty for their prediction models. We will use recent advances in statistics and machine learning—the so-called conformal prediction framework—to add prediction intervals to their models. The researchers will upload their models and part of their data on our platform website. We will then build prediction intervals for their models and deliver them back to the researchers as a download.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur four-step platform workflow\n\n\n\nUpload Your Prediction Model?\n\nAre you interested in adding prediction intervals to your prediction model?

    "text": "Conference\n\n\n\nConference group picture\n\n\nIn March 2025, we had the privilege of attending the Ascona Workshop to present our RAI Platform project (slides are available here). Co-organized by Prof. Mark Robinson (University of Zurich) and Prof. Jean Yang (University of Sydney), this three-day event at Monte Verità brought together numerous contributors to scientific research.\nAt the heart of the conference was a shared goal: to present the latest benchmarking studies in bioinformatics, computational biology, and molecular biology, while also engaging in collective reflection on the principles and guidelines our scientific community wishes to establish for benchmarking.\nThis reflection raised complex and essential questions: How can we ensure the scientific integrity of benchmarking studies? How can we promote transparency in data analysis and simulation procedures? How do we move toward shared evaluation standards? And more broadly, how can we foster stronger scientific collaboration and knowledge-sharing across research groups? How do we teach and convey to the next generation of researchers the tremendous value of scientific cooperation—beyond individual ambition? Benchmarking is a relatively new yet increasingly central area of research, playing a prominent role in recent scientific publications. A typical benchmarking study brings together a team of researchers to compare existing methods that address a specific scientific question. Based on scientifically sound and relevant evaluation criteria, each method is tested and compared using either synthetic datasets (which offer the advantage of including a known ground truth—allowing, for example, false discovery rates and true positive rates to be measured in classification tasks) or real-world datasets, which can be used for tasks such as power analysis.\nThe contribution of benchmarking is far from negligible. It enables the scientific community to efficiently identify the most suitable method depending on the problem at hand, the resources available, and other contextual factors. Just as importantly, it helps method developers pinpoint areas where their approaches can be improved.\nBeyond the scientific aspects, we also enjoyed a beautiful excursion to Brissago Island, just off the coast of Ascona, where we explored its rich historical and botanical heritage. Finally, the workshop offered a fantastic opportunity to meet fellow researchers from around the world—including the US, Australia, Germany, and Spain—from early-career PhD students to renowned bioinformatics figures such as Matt Ritchie, one of the co-creators of the limma R-package, with whom I had the honor of sharing breakfast."
